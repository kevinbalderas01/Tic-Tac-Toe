# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a tic-tac-toe version made in my free time. I used Python and pygame<br>
We only need to run the app.py and we will see a board like the following:<br>
<img src="images/Screenshot (4640)"><br>
Then, we are ready to play , by just clicking in the box you want. If you are the first player, your color is <FONT COLOR="blue">blue</FONT>.<br>

But if you are the second player, you get the <FONT COLOR="red">red</FONT> color.<br>
